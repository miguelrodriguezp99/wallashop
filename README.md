# WallaShop - A Wallapop Clone Project

## Introduction

WallaShop is a capstone project for my final year in college, aiming to replicate the core functionalities of the popular buying and selling platform, Wallapop. This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of applying modern web development and software engineering principles to create a fully functional web application. WallaShop enables users to post products for sale, like posts, comment on them, and engage in discussions through replies, creating a vibrant community around buying and selling items.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Utilized for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **NextUI:** Employed for designing a sleek, modern UI with out-of-the-box React components.
- **Spring Boot:** Used for creating a robust, scalable backend.
- **Maven:** A build automation tool used for managing project dependencies.
- **MySQL:** The database choice for storing user data, product information, likes, and comments.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for designing custom, responsive layouts with minimal CSS.
- **CSS:** For additional styling needs, complementing Tailwind CSS.
- **WebSocket:** Implemented for real-time communication features, enhancing interactivity in comments and live updates.

## Core Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Allows users to create an account, login, and manage their profiles.
- **Product Posts:** Users can post items for sale, including images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Likes and Comments:** Features to like posts and comment on them, fostering community engagement.
- **Reply to Comments:** Enables threaded conversations by allowing replies to specific comments.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Leveraging WebSocket for real-time notifications and updates in user interactions.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of WallaShop is to demonstrate the ability to develop a full-stack application that incorporates both front-end and back-end technologies to replicate essential features of an existing web application. This project emphasizes:

- Building a secure, scalable web application.
- Implementing a clean, intuitive user interface.
- Ensuring real-time functionality in user interactions.
- Applying CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a relational database environment.

## Challenges and Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of WallaShop, several challenges were encountered, including:

- Designing a user-friendly interface while ensuring responsiveness across devices.
- Managing state across the application to reflect real-time updates.
- Ensuring the security of user data and implementing efficient, secure authentication mechanisms.
- Optimizing database queries for performance and scalability.

These challenges provided valuable learning experiences in web development, database management, and application security, contributing significantly to my professional growth as a software developer.

## Conclusion

WallaShop is not just a project but a testament to the practical application of software engineering principles in creating a functional, real-world application. While the project currently does not have a live web page, the skills and knowledge gained from its development are invaluable and will undoubtedly contribute to future endeavors in the field of software development.
